# Greek Yoghurt

Thick, tangy and unsweetened yoghurt. Makes a great ingredient or base for flavoured yoghurt

## Ingredients
- Full cream milk (1 litre)
- Greek Yoghurt (65 ml)

## Method
- Heat the milk, gently, to 85 degrees C.
- Cool to 42 degrees C.
- Mix some of the milk in with your 'starter' yoghurt to thin it out.
- Pour the starter into the milk.
- Cover and leave somewhere warm for 6-8 hours. An oven preheated to 40-45 degrees C, then turned off is perfect. At this point it should be set and you should see some whey separating out.
- Chill in the fridge.
- (Optionally) strain with cheesecloth to your desired consistency.

## Notes
- You can add more of the 'starter' yoghurt, which may shorten the setting time
- An ice bath can help cool the milk faster. Some ice and water in the sink is an easy way to do this.
