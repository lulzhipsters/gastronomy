## Notes
- Lye solution is caustic and contact with skin should be avoided. Fumes can also be an issue.
- Shaping how-to coming soon. [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/bavarian-style-soft-pretzels-recipe-7967998#toc-techniques-for-properly-shaping-the-pretzels) shaping advice is good.
- Still trying to get a handle on the blistering. Have heard differing reports on reasons for this. Some ways to avoid this to try:
  - Lower temperature on bake and/or avoid convection mode
  - Form a thicker 'skin' by leaving to dry longer after lye bath
  - Longer lye bath, combined with either of the above to encourage a tougher skin.

## Ingredients
- 500g flour (all purpose or bread flour)
- 15g brown sugar
- 30g butter (room temperature)
- 10g salt
- 4g dry yeast
- 275ml warm water
- 4% lye solution (12g lye to 300ml cold water)
- coarse or pretzel salt for topping

## Method
1. Mix sugar, water and yeast. Proof 5-10 minutes.
2. Mix flour and salt.
3. Add butter and yeast mixture to flour and salt.
4. Let rest for 10 min.
5. Knead for 10 min (by hand).
7. Separate into 80-100g pieces.
8. Shape. See how-to in notes.
9. Rest, uncovered, for at least 30 min.
10. Dip pretzels in lye solution for ~10 sec each, flipping halfway through. Once dipped, place on baking paper or silicone mat. Sprinkle lightly with coarse salt.
11. Rest, uncovered, in fridge until ready to bake.
12. Optionally slit each pretzel, or let them crack during baking themselves.
13. Bake at 180 degrees C (with fan) for ~12 minutes until evenly golden-brown. Watch them carefully and rotate as required.

## Variations
- Pretzel rolls - Roll dough into balls and slit the top.
- Large pretzels - Separate into 250-300g pieces.
